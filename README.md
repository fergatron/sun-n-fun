# sun-n-fun

This project is a scenery add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The focus is to bring some life to the Lakeland Linder International Airport (LAL), which hosts the annual fly-in and airshow--SUN n' FUN!

I'm planning to add static planes and people around the airport to make it come to life.
